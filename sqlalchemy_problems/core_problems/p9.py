# 9. Subquery and Filtering (Hard)
# Task:
# Create a subquery that computes the average salary for each department from the employee table.
# Then write a main query to select all employees whose salary is above the departmentâ€™s average.
#
# Requirement:
# Use a Core subquery and then join or filter against it.
#
# Hint:
# Use subq = select(employee.c.department, func.avg(employee.c.salary).label("avg_salary")).group_by
#     (employee.c.department).subquery() and then filter with a join condition.
