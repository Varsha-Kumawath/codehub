# 8. Aggregation Query (Mediumâ€“Hard)
#
# Task:
# Using the employee table, write a query to calculate the total salary expenditure per department.
#
# Requirement:
# Group by the department column and sum the salaries.
#
# Hint:
# Use func.sum() from SQLAlchemy along with group_by(employee.c.department).
